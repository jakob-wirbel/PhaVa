v0.2.2
-Add a function to predict the effect of an inversion whenever
it is within a gene [part of the `create` command]

v0.2.1
-Add `cluster` command to cluster IRs based on flanking and 
internal regions, using mmseqs2

v0.2.0
-Add short read option for the `ratio` command, using 
bowtie [!development version!]

v0.1.1
-Add header to ratio.tsv output
-Add header to IRs.tsv output
-Add geneOverlap output to ratio.tsv (when available)
-Relocate IRs.tsv, invertedSeqs.fasta and geneOverlaps.tsv outputs to the
output ‘data’ subdirectory, to help clarify which outputs are important for
standard use 
-Add —minRC option for ratio step, allowing prefiltering of output by number
of reads mapped to ‘inverted’ versions of invertons
-Update and simplify the installation test script
